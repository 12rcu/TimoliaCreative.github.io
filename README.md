# TranClate

A Kotlin library that wraps the whole development process of a Minecraft Bedrock Project and thus provides
a streamlined development experience with

- Autocompletion
- Integrated Documentation
- A debugger that already works in the IDE and gives usefully feedback
- Prevent invalid Code
- The usage of Kotlin as a Tool to minimize Code duplications 

## Concept

The whole concept of TranClate is a [Kotlin DSL](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/type-safe-builders.html) it's intention is
to let the developer only write compilable code, in our case we want to make sure a developer can only write code that
is within the limits of Minecraft.
